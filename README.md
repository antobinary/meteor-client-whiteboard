Bigbluebutton Whiteboard Meteor Client
--------------------------------------

# Description

# Getting started

    sudo npm install -g meteor-npm
    sudo npm install -g meteorite
    mrt install

Run it with `mrt run`


# Current instructions:
 Run with `[sudo] meteor`
 go to port 3000
 verify that the sample shape is recognized - look in the upper-right corner
 click on Draw (near the title)
 there are a few alerts helping to see where we are in the code.
 this version of the code does not display any drawings...
 If you wish to retry drawing (perhaps after code changes) erase the /abc in the url.
 I needed to change the url and redirect because otherwise the page was re-rendering itself multiple times

# Progress

 * Integrate old code [X]
 * Save BBB server messages as Meteor Collections [X] //in the Meteor client
 * Draw slides [ ]
